# flybys_bin

Compute the secular effects of binary-binary scattering.

Requirements: Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib (for plots). For N-body integrations, `Rebound` (https://github.com/hannorein/rebound) is required, or, alternatively, `ABIE` (https://github.com/maxwelltsai/ABIE) can be used.

Usage: run the script using `python bin.py` with the desired command line options. Run `python bin.py --help` for an overview of the available options.
